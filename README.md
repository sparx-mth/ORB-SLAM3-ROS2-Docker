# Steps to use this wrapper

## 1. Clone this repository

1. ```git clone -b traversability_integration https://github.com/suchetanrs/ORB-SLAM3-ROS2-Docker```
2. ```cd ORB-SLAM3-ROS2-Docker```
3. ```git submodule update --init --recursive --remote```
4. ```git submodule update```

## 2. Install Docker on your system

```bash
cd ORB-SLAM3-ROS2-Docker
sudo chmod +x container_root/shell_scripts/docker_install.sh
./container_root/shell_scripts/docker_install.sh
```

## 3. Build the image with ORB_SLAM3

1. Build the image: ```sudo docker build --build-arg USE_CI=false -t orb-slam3-humble:22.04 .```
2. Add ```xhost +``` to your ```.bashrc``` to support correct x11-forwarding using ```echo "xhost +" >> ~/.bashrc```
3. ```source ~/.bashrc```
4. You can see the built images on your machine by running ```sudo docker images```.

## 4. Running the container

1. ```cd ORB-SLAM3-ROS2-Docker``` (ignore if you are already in the folder)
2. ```sudo docker compose run orb_slam3_22_humble```
3. This should take you inside the container. Once you are inside, run the command ```xeyes``` and a pair of eyes should pop-up. If they do, x11 forwarding has correctly been setup on your computer.

## 5. Building the ORB-SLAM3 Wrapper

Launch the container using steps in (4).
```bash
cd /home/traversability/traversability_mapping && ./build.sh
cd /home/orb/ORB_SLAM3/ && sudo chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh
cd /root/trav_ws/ && colcon build --symlink-install && source install/setup.bash
cd /root/colcon_ws/ && colcon build --symlink-install && source install/setup.bash
```

## Launching ORB-SLAM3

Launch the container using steps in (4).
If you are inside the container, run the following:

1. ```ros2 launch orb_slam3_ros2_wrapper unirobot.launch.py```
3. You can adjust the initial co-ordinates of the robot along with its namespace in the ```unirobot.launch.py``` file.

## Running this with a Gazebo Classic simulation.

1. Setup the ORB-SLAM3 ROS2 Docker using the steps above. Once you do (1) step in the ```Launching ORB-SLAM3``` section, you should see a window popup which is waiting for images. This is partially indicative of the setup correctly done.
2. Setup the simulation by following the README [here](https://github.com/suchetanrs/gz-sim-environment)
3. Once you are able to teleop the robot, you should be able to run ORB-SLAM3 with both the containers (simulation and wrapper) running parallely.

### Potential issues you may face.
The simulation and the wrapper both have their ```ROS_DOMAIN_ID``` set to 55 so they are meant to work out of the box. However, you may face issues if this environment variable is not set properly. Before you start the wrapper, run ```ros2 topic list``` and make sure the topics namespaced with ```robot_0``` are visible inside the ORB-SLAM3 container provided the simulation is running along the side.


## Important notes

ORB-SLAM3 is launched from ```orb_slam3_docker_20_humble/orb_slam3_ros2_wrapper/launch/rgbd.launch.py``` which inturn is launched from ```orb_slam3_docker_20_humble/orb_slam3_ros2_wrapper/launch/unirobot.launch.py```

Currently the ```rgbd.launch.py``` launch file defaults to ```orb_slam3_ros2_wrapper/params/gazebo_rgbd.yaml```. You can modify this with your own parameter file in case you wish to use your own camera.

The very initial versions of this code were derived from [thien94/orb_slam3_ros_wrapper](https://github.com/thien94/orb_slam3_ros_wrapper) and [zang9/ORB_SLAM3_ROS2](https://github.com/zang09/ORB_SLAM3_ROS2)

## ROS Parameter descriptions
| Parameter Name          | Default Value | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `robot_base_frame`      | `base_footprint` | The name of the frame attached to the robot's base. |
| `global_frame`          | `map`         | The name of the global frame of reference. It represents a fixed world coordinate frame in which the robot navigates.|
| `odom_frame`            | `odom`        | The name of the odometry frame. |
| `robot_x`               | `0.0`         | The robot's initial x-coordinate in the global frame. Specifies the starting position along the x-axis. The SLAM Wrapper will assume this to be the initial x position|
| `robot_y`               | `0.0`         | The robot's initial y-coordinate in the global frame. Specifies the starting position along the y-axis. The SLAM Wrapper will assume this to be the initial y position|
| `visualization`         | `true`        | A boolean flag to enable or disable visualization. When set to `true`, the ORB-SLAM3 viewer will show up with the tracked points and the keyframe trajectories.|
| `ros_visualization`     | `false`       | A boolean flag to control ROS-based visualization. If set to `true`, it enables ROS tools like RViz to visualize the robot's data. (3D position of the tracked points etc.)  **This feature is unstable and not tested as of now**|
| `odometry_mode`      | `false`       | A boolean flag to toggle odometry mode. When `false`, the system operates without relying on odometry data, which might be used in scenarios where odometry information is unavailable or unreliable. In this case, it publishes the transform directly between the ```global_frame``` and the ```robot_base_frame```|
| `publish_tf`               | `true`         | Publishes the map->odom tf in case odometry_mode is set to `true` and map->odom->base_link in case odometry_mode is set to `false`.|
| `map_data_publish_frequency`| `1000`         | Time interval at which map_data should be published (ms).|
